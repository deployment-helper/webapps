I need to prepare an MCQ  for Indian students. 

Indian students are not very good with English words so you need to use as simple as possible easy words. 

I want you to provide a response in JSON format. 

The total number of questions will be 20 please provide questions one by one. 

Please provide questions in history order meaning if two development happened one in 2021 and second in 2022 so question to related development 2021 should come first and question of development 2022 should come second. 


```js
{
  "questionEn": "Question in english in markdown ",
  "questionHi": "Question in hinglish in markdown",
  "options": [
    {
      "en": "Option `1` in **hinglish** markdown"
    },
    {
      "en": "Option `2` in **hinglish** *markdown*"
    },
    {
      "en": "Option 3 in hinglish markdown"
    },
    {
      "en": "Option 4 in hinglish markdown",
      "isRight": true
    }
  ],
  "rightAnswer": {
